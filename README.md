# Useful Vagrant Configurations
This repos contains a couple of simple but useful configs I've repeatedly used over time, which demonstrate some of the functionality possible with Vagrant

## Usage
These `Vagrantfile`s are targeted at systems using Virtualbox, so in addition to Vagrant, you'll need Virtualbox installed.  If you want to use shared folders, you'll also need the Virtualbox Extension Pack installed.
